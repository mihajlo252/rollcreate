⚠️ Project Archived

This project is no longer actively maintained. It began as a personal tool for managing Dungeons & Dragons campaigns, with a secondary feature for character creation. Over time, the focus shifted toward building a more robust and dedicated system for character sheets and creation — not just for D&D, but with support for other TTRPGs planned in the future.

Development on the new project began in 2024 and is nearing it's first iteration. Key insights and lessons from this original version have been carried over into the new system. Please feel free to explore the new project for the latest updates and continued work <a href="https://https://github.com/mihajlo252/the-scrollforge" target="_blank" className="link text-primary">
